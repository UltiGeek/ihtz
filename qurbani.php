            <h1>Qurbani</h1>
            <p>On the occasion of the Eid Ul Adha which is celebrated to mark the completion of the annual Hajj Muslims around the world honour the tradition of the prophet Ibrahim A.S. by sacrificing an animal and distributing the meat to those in need.</p>
            <p>Our Qurbani programme, part of our iHelp Feed the World campaign, allows donors to select those they would like to see benefit from the ritual sacrifice that they make on the occasion of Eid Ul Adha. We organise the distribution of fresh meat to vulnerable people afflicted by poverty or affected by natural or man-made disasters.</p>

            <p>Islamic Help Tanzania is now providing Qurbani for the third year in a row; the project targets all the orphans who are directly registered with the organization and their immediate siblings, relatives and other people in Islamic Help&rsquo;s operational areas.</p>
            <p>Islamic Help Tanzania appreciates the fact that it was able to expand the area of distribution where there need was profound and each package of the meat distributed to the families provided a meal for a week.</p>
