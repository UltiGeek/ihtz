            <h1>Emergency Response</h1>
            <p>As natural disasters, manmade disasters, conflict and climate change remain an increasing threat to the most needy of the world’s population so the need to respond appropriately to their plight heightens.  Communities and peoples that struggle to survive on a dollar a day are usually most acutely affected by any such disaster or conflict and the destabilising effects of it.  As demonstrated by the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the earthquake in New Zealand such disasters have a catastrophic effect on more prosperous nations and communities too – in the short term and immediate aftermath of such disasters they too need our support. Islamic Help is committed to responding to all such disasters so as to alleviate human suffering.</p>

            <p>In the charity’s early days with little but enthusiasm, good will and sheer determination we were able to respond to major disasters like the Indian Ocean Tsunami 2004.  We have continued our commitment and the following disasters and crises are just some of the ones we have been able to respond to:</p>

            <h5 align='center'>Indian Ocean Tsunami 2004    Niger and Mali Drought 2005</h5>
            <h5 align='center'>South Asian Earthquake 2005    Cyclone Sidr 2007</h5>
            <h5 align='center'>Baluchistan Floods 2007    Hurricane Alia 2008</h5>
            <h5 align='center'>Swat Valley Crisis 2009    Haiti Earthquake 2010</h5>
            <h5 align='center'>Pakistan Floods 2010 Jangwani Floods 2010</h5>
            <h5 align='center'>Pakistan Floods 2013 Yemen Floods 2013</h5>

            <p>Our response to any disaster or crisis is determined by the disaster or crisis itself; our Disaster Response Team decides on the scale the of the response. However the provision of water, food, shelter and medical aid are almost invariably given priority and we try to ensure that those that we reach are provided with these fundamentals in the immediate aftermath of any disaster.</p>



            <p>On Boxing Day 2004 the west coast of Northern Sumatra was the epicentre of what is believed to have been the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph of a magnitude between 9.1 and 9.3.  It triggered a series of devastating tsunamis which left over 230,000 people dead, hundreds of thousands injured and over 1.5 million displaced.  It was one of the deadliest recorded disasters in history.</p>

            <p>Islamic Help sent disaster relief teams to Banda Aceh, Indonesia – one of the worst hit areas.  We were able to provide much needed medical aid and medicines for the injured; we also donated a fully equipped ambulance.  We also carried out a food distribution programme which included Qurbani distribution and eid gifts distribution.</p>
            <p>Following the emergency response Islamic Help undertook a long term project to contribute to the rebuilding effort following the Tsunami  - we have built two orphanages housing 600 children and a school in the region.</p>
